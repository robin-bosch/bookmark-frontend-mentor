## My process

### Challenges

- Getting the interactive elements to work
- Having the blue background pills work on all screen sizes
- Working with two different navigation menus

### What I learned

- First time making a FAQ section in vanilla JavaScript
- First time making a carousel in vanilla JavaScript

## Technologies used

### Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

All was written in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Frameworks used

- Fontawesome

## Validation and Testing

### HTML Validation

HTML validation was done with the [W3 HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) and came back with no warnings.

### CSS Validation

CSS validation was done with the [W3 CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and came back with warnings regarding the variables which are currently not checked.

### Accessibility Testing

Accessibility was checked with the browser extension of the [WAVE validator](https://wave.webaim.org/) and came back with contrast errors for the text which is given from the design and one label error for the email input which is not needed.

### Device Testing

The website was tested on the following devices:

- Windows 11 PC (Screen resolution: 2560x1440)
- Xiaomi MI 9 with Android 11 (Screen resolution: 1080x2280)
- Xiaomi Pad 6 with Android 12 (Screen resolution: 1800x2880)

Other screen resolutions were tested in the browser with dev tools from 2560x1440 down to 320x568.
